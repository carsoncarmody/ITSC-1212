# Given two integer numbers, one is the number of teachers and the 
other is the number of apples. We want to distribute the apples 
venly among them. The remaining (the indivisible) part remans 
in the basket. Write an algorithm using pseudocode that 
would display the number of apples each single 
teacher gets and the number of apples 
remaining in the basket. Translate 
your algorithm to Python code.
